export const story = "With the chair restored and its magic renewed, Joseph was granted, thanks to the chair, a magical staff and a spellbook. He then decided to embark towards the Wound's Valley Inn, a magical refuge where he hoped to find a new purpose for his life torn apart by madness and obsession. Without the company of the villagers, who still held their distrust towards him, Joseph ventured alone, guiding the chair in a magic bubble so he didn't have to carry it through the Lowlands. On a stormy night, he dreamt of visions from the past, revealing the true nature of the chair, and his own internal struggles. The chair's magic, though restored, still toyed with his sanity, but Joseph was determined. The journey continued through endless challenges. Joseph, with thechair as his sole companion, rediscovered the inner strength he had lost in his previous madness. The chair, now more than a mere object,became an ally in his journey of self-affirmation. Finally, after days of travel, Joseph arrived at the last challenge he had to face, the catacombs. Horrible things awaited him if he wanted to achieve his destiny. Horrible creatures, and the catacomb itself which had really difficult trials to keep away the humans of the resting souls."
